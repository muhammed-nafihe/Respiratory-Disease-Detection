* We have started clustering of the data set and started discussing CNN architecture. </br>
* Finalised to do  with two clustering methods namely K-means clustering for the datatset. </br>
* We have supervised data, so that clustering is not necessary. But we have done clustering bby removing the attribute which contains all 
  disease classes.
* Our data is also a unbalanced data, so before doing clustering we need to balance our data.
* We choosed Elbow method to find the accurate number of custers for our data.
