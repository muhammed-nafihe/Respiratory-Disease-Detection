* Completed the clustering methods with balanced and processed dataset of respiratory Sound.</br>
* Applied two clusering methods as K-Means to the dataset and visualized the clustering results.</br>
* Finally visualizing these clusters by elbow method we got an optimal number of clusters from the elbow plot as 3
* The visualization likely shows the data points grouped into three distinct clusters and three centriods each representing a grouping of similar data points.</br>
* Started with Decision Tree and decided to do Classification decision tree because of our target variables are categorical.
* We know that our dataset is unbalanced and we need do either undersapling or oversampling.
* We decided to do classification Report, confussion matrix to evaluate our Decision tree model.
* We need do tuning of hyperparameter, for that we found a function called GridsearchCV
