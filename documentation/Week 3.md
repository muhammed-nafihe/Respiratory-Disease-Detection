Discussed various topics and available datasets on different websites by each member.</br>
Discussed datasets are Image classification dataset, Traffic sign data, Respiratory Sound dataset and Dog breed classification.</br>
Based on the scope,real life relavance we thought working on audio files and that too on breathing sounds is more challenging and better to understand the coursework.</br>
Then finanlize a dataset named Respiratory Sound Dataset. we also planned some works for next week such as making a better plan to work out our project perfectly and to go through the dataset which is selected.</br>

The team members each found the following datasets and we discussed about the plans we could implement on each.</br>
Vishnu - Traffic sign dataset </br>
Nafihe - Dog breed classification dataset </br>
Maria - Image classification dataset </br>
Tijo - Respiratory Sound dataset </br>
